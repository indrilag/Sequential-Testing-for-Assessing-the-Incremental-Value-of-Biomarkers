# Incremental-Value-of-Biomarkers

This folder contains R codes for evaluating the incremental effects of biomarkers using a 2-stage group sequential procedure as proposed in `Sequential Testing for Assessing the Incremental
Value of Biomarkers Using Biorepository Specimens' by Indrila Ganguly and Ying Huang.

The R files "simulation_test_probs_both.R" and "simulation_test_probs_fut.R" contain example codes to compute the probabilities of rejection of the null hypothesis under the null and alternative hypotheses, for stopping under both futility and efficacy or stopping under futility only, respectively. The R files "simulation_rotation_both.R" and "simulation_rotation_fut.R" contain example codes to compute the estimates of $E(n^*)$, $E(n_u^*)$ and $E(n_u^{t*})$ for stopping under both futility and efficacy or stopping under futility only.
